Instead of merely responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at both premiums and total estimated costs for individuals like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might need a $15 copay when you see the doctor.<p>
<p>The basic enrollment interval for Original Medicare is from January 1 by way of March 31 of every year. Keep in mind that you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B if you did not join if you have been first eligible. If you have health coverage via current employment (either by way of your work or your spouse’s employer), you may resolve to delay Medicare Part B enrollment. You ought to speak together with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you perceive how your current coverage works with Medicare and what the consequences could be if you drop Medicare Part B.<p>

<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to maintain it once you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment period that lasts eight months.
