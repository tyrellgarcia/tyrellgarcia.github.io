<p>A rebate can't contribute to "revenue" ("revenue" is in quotes as a result of most Medicare Advantage and different Part C health plans are sponsored by non-revenue organizations, primarily integrated health supply techniques). In 2017, the typical out-of-pocket limit for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the same as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $4,313 in 2011 . HMO enrollees have usually had decrease out-of-pocket limits than enrollees in local PPOs or regional PPOs, and this remains the case in 2017.

If you don't make any changes during AEP, your present plan will routinely renew the next yr. If you drop a Medicare Advantage plan during AEP and don't enroll in one other one, you'll mechanically return to Original Medicare.Remember this might imply you will lose drug coverage if it was included together with your plan.<p>
