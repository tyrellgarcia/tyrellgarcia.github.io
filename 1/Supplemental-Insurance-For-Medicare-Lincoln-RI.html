<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans usually also have greater deductibles, so you must rigorously compare these plans along with your income earlier than you decide. Instead of merely responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and complete estimated costs for people like your self.

<p>Most Americans begin accumulating social security as quickly as they will.
