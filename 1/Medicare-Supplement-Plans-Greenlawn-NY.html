<p>Over this period, the share of Medicare beneficiaries in group plans increased significantly in Alabama and New Jersey because of changes in the states’ benefits for former state staff for the 2017 plan year. Enrollment in SNPs increased modestly from 2.6 million beneficiaries in 2018 to 2.9 million beneficiaries in 2019, accounting for about thirteen percent of total Medicare Advantage enrollment in 2019, with some variation throughout states.

<p>You and your partner pay separate premiums for Medicare benefits under Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D should you sign up for it. If one or each of you choose to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you'll continue to pay individually the Medicare Part B premium and presumably a separate plan premium.

You can sign up for Medicare Part B at any time that you've got coverage via present or energetic employment. Or you'll be able to sign up for Medicare during the eight-month Special Enrollment Period that starts when your employer or union group coverage ends or you stop working . If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you cease working, keep in mind that this doesn’t depend as coverage based on present employment; make sure you don’t wait till your COBRA benefits finish to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>
