You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months when you don’t want to.

You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
