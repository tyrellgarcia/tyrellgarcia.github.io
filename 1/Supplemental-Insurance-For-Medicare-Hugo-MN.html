<p>You also can have a number of benefit intervals if you get care in a psychiatric hospital.

Work together with your main care provider and your family to choose a plan that you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use probably the most. Advantage plans limit what you possibly can pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
