<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
