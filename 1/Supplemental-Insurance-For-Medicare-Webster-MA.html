<p>However, home partners (identical-gender and reverse-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are advised to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The rules are completely different for workers and retirees; so to make certain you enroll properly, keep away from Medicare premium penalties and perceive how Medicare works together with your UC-sponsored medical plan, observe these steps. If you do not make any changes during AEP, your present plan will mechanically renew the following year.
