<p>Just keep in mind that should you choose to attend to enroll in Part B, you’ll be charged a late enrollment penalty, and Part B coverage will cost you extra. You need to have both Part A and Part B to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Supplement plan. You don't should enroll in Part B immediately, because you'll be charged a premium.
