<p>Third, individuals who live in two completely different geographical areas of the country at completely different instances of the yr (principally so-known as snowbirds) find it tough to stay with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C danger adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how effective that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits differently. For example, plans that require larger out-of-pocket prices than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, corresponding to expert nursing facility care, might offer decrease copayments for physician visits to steadiness their benefits bundle.<p>
<p>But these averages masks broad regional and beneficial differences.

(You should pay the Part B premium in addition to your Advantage premium, even if you’re in a “zero premium” Advantage plan). Across all Medicare Advantage plans, the average premium is about $23/month in 2020.
