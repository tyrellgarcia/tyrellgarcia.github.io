<p>Recently, I began a component-time job and saw that the corporate in withdrawal money for Medicare. When very small employers join along with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as at least one of the employers has 20+ workers. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check together with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.

<p>Be sure to be mindful that when he does take Social Security, he might be enrolled in Part A, effective six months retroactively. Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the year, which could lead to penalties.
