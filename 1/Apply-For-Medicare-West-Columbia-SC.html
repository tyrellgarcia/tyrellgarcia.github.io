<p>Plan costs are generally lower than those of different Medicare Advantage plan types, but you’re usually limited to medical doctors in the plan’s provider community. Medicare Advantage plans could provide extra (“supplemental”) benefits that are not provided in traditional Medicare, and can use rebate dollars to help cover the price of additional benefits.
