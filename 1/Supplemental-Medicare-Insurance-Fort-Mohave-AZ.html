<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.
