This interval starts two months before the contract ends and runs an additional month after the contract ends. If Medicare terminates your plan’s contract, you'll have a Special Election Period that begins 1 month earlier than the termination effective date and ends 2 months after the efficient date of the termination.

<p>If you might be turning 65 and have employer-based coverage through your personal job, you possibly can delay signing up.
