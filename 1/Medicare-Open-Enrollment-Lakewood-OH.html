If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
