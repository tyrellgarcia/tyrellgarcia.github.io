An MA plan should provide enrollees in that plan with coverage of all providers which are covered by Medicare Parts A and B, plus extra benefits beyond those lined by Medicare. These plans are known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>

You might need to pay this higher premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
<p>The MA-PD premium consists of both the cost of Medicare-covered Part A and Part B benefits and Part D prescription drug coverage. Among MA-PD enrollees who pay a premium for their plan, the common premium is $63 per 30 days. Altogether, including those that don't pay a premium, the common MA-PD enrollee pays $25 per 30 days in 2020.<p>
