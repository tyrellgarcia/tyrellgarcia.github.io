<p>People with ESRD have the option to enroll in Medicare Advantage for 2021, and CMS expects more than 40,000 to do so.

Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively expensive companies, such as inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, however occasionally required for preventive services. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to make use of “step remedy” for Part B drugs, which means that they're required to strive some particular medication before they receive approval to try different medication. In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, conventional Medicare doesn't usually require prior authorization for services, and doesn't require step remedy for Part B drugs.<p>
