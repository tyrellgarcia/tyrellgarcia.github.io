<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 have to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union legal guidelines mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

Also check the price of any premiums, co-pays, and different out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits of their coverage. If additional benefits are included, similar to assist with hearing aids and dental payments, remember to learn how much of these expenses will really be coated.<p>
