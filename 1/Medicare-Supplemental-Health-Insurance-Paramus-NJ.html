<p>People who aren’t yet collecting Social Security, or aren’t eligible for Social Security Retirement, aren’t routinely enrolled into Medicare. Some people get Medicare Part A and Part B routinely and a few folks want to enroll in them.<p>

At that point, you would want to enroll in Part B, however may now not qualify for the SEP if you delayed enrolling for more than eight months. If you’re glad together with your present Medicare plan, you don’t must take any action. However, plan particulars can change yearly, so you might want to compare your plan options for every to verify your health and prescription drug needs are lined by your plan for the following yr.
