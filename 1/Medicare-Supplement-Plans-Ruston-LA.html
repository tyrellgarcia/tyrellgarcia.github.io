If you’re enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B , you’re eligible to enroll in a Medigap plan to supplement your Medicare coverage. You’ll have a six-month guaranteed-issue window throughout which you'll be able to join any Medigap plan available in your space. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll need to go through medical underwriting when you decide to apply for a Medigap plan after that window ends. During the five-star enrollment period (December eight – November 30), individuals who live in an space with a 5-star Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan can swap to that plan in the event that they choose to take action.<p>
<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether or not and how it will pay in the event that they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B. Determining whether a person qualifies for a Special Enrollment Period is the primary important issue to consider when making a choice about Part B enrollment. People who are eligible for Medicare based mostly on disability may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period based on their or their partner’s present employment. They could also be eligible primarily based on a spouse or family member’s current employment if the employer has a hundred or extra workers.<p>
<p>If you qualify, you can return to Original Medicare or join, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you choose to go back to Original Medicare in this qualifying event, you may also apply for a Medicare Supplement plan.

Some states may have additional open enrollment periods, and there may be different situations in which your acceptance could also be assured.<p>
