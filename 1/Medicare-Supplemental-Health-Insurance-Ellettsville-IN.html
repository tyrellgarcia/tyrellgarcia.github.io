MA plans differ with respect to what benefits they supply, out-of-pocket prices similar to premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and whether they provide prescription drug coverage. It is important to keep in mind that in case you are happy together with your Medicare benefits, whether you are in traditional Medicare or an MA plan, you don't HAVE to vary when the chance arises.
