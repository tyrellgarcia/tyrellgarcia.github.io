Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare version or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn sixty five, once Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>
