<p>HMOs — These plans provide medical coverage and health care from a selected set of docs, specialists, and hospitals that are within a plan's permitted network.

<p>The basic enrollment period for Original Medicare is from January 1 by way of March 31 of every year. Keep in mind that you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B when you didn't enroll whenever you had been first eligible. If you have health coverage through present employment (either by way of your work or your spouse’s employer), you might decide to delay Medicare Part B enrollment. You ought to converse with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you perceive how your present coverage works with Medicare and what the implications could be should you drop Medicare Part B.<p>
<p>When you start Part B, it triggers a particular election period that permits you to make changes to your coverage outdoors of the usual enrollment periods.

Or you'll be able to join Medicare through the eight-month Special Enrollment Period that begins when your employer or union group coverage ends or you stop working . If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you stop working, remember that this doesn’t count as coverage based mostly on current employment; make sure you don’t wait until your COBRA benefits finish to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>
