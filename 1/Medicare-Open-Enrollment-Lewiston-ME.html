<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

You have a number of options when the time comes for you to enroll in Medicare. For some folks, Medicare enrollment is computerized, whereas for others, it may depend upon when and how they become eligible. Enroll in the prescription drug plan when you’re first eligible to do so, in the course of the IEP for Part D.<p>
<p>If you're eligible for premium-free Part A and you don’t enroll in Part A and B earlier than your 65th birthday, you would lose your UC-sponsored medical coverage and be charged penalties by RASC and lifelong penalties by Medicare. Ninety days earlier than you flip 65, RASC will ship you the Medicare forms you'll must fill out, along with the date UC needs you to enroll in Medicare and return the forms.

Ninety days before your sixty fifth birthday, RASC will send you a letter with details about enrolling in Medicare.
