<p>As a retiree this happens when you turn sixty five; as a UC employee this occurs if you retire and you're 65 or older. Medicare Part A is usually premium-free, but there is a monthly premium for Part B coverage, paid to the Social Security Administration.<p>
<p>Be positive to consider how you may pay for the issues Medicare would not cover. For instance, it usually would not cover dental work and routine vision or hearing care.
