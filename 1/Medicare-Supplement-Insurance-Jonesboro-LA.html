If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% larger premium for every 12-month period that you just have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it. You may should pay this larger premium for as long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>

The initial enrollment period for Medicare parts A and B begins three months earlier than your sixty fifth birthday, includes the month of your birthday, and continues for 3 months after.
