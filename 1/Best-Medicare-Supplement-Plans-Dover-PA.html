This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>Medicare Part B covers your outpatient medical companies, like your annual wellness exam.
