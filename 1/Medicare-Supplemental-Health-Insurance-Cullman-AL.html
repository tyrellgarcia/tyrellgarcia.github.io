<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B during your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to attend until the subsequent General Enrollment Period, which occurs from January 1 to March 31 every year. You may then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B because you could have had Part B and didn't enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% higher premium for each 12-month interval that you just have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t join it.
