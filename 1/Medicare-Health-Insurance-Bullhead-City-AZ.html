<p>But you’ll still need to pay the federal government a premium for Part B, along with the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage (which may be $0, relying on the plan). Any time during the 12 months, a person enrolled in Original Medicare can apply for a different Medigap plan. But if it’s not through the person’s one-time Medigap enrollment window, the insurer will likely use medical underwriting to find out whether to concern the coverage and at what value.<p>
<p>Part B benefits cover certain non-hospital medical bills like docs’ workplace visits, blood checks, X-rays, diabetic screenings and supplies, and outpatient hospital care.

If you’re not being given a selection then that’s something to first tackle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
