<p>Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, is health coverage supplied by private insurance firms. Medicare Advantage plans provide the identical benefits as Original Medicare and infrequently includes further coverage such as prescribed drugs, dental, imaginative and prescient, and hearing.

It is essential to do not forget that in case you are pleased with your Medicare benefits, whether you are in traditional Medicare or an MA plan, you don't HAVE to alter when the opportunity arises.
