Look for specific Medicare drug plan prices, after which call the plans you are excited about to get extra details. Most people do not pay a monthly premium for Part A (sometimes known as "premium-free Part A"). If you paid Medicare taxes for lower than 30 quarters, the standard Part A premium is $458.
