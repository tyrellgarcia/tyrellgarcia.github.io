<p>Enrollment in I-SNPs has been growing, but continues to be lower than one hundred,000 beneficiaries. For a few years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has posted quality ratings of Medicare Advantage plans to offer beneficiaries with further details about plans provided in their space. Prior authorization is most frequently required for relatively costly providers, such as inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but infrequently required for preventive companies. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can also require enrollees to make use of “step therapy” for Part B medicine, that means that they're required to try some specific medication earlier than they obtain approval to try different medicine.
