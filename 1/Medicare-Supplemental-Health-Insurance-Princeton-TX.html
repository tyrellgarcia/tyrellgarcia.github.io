<p>Medicare Advantage Plans are not authorities-managed health plans. They are private plans provided by Medicare-accredited suppliers.

<p>Medicare Advantage is a kind of medical health insurance plan within the United States that gives Medicare benefits through a personal-sector health insurer. In a Medicare Advantage plan, a Medicare beneficiary pays a month-to-month premium to a non-public insurance firm and receives coverage for inpatient hospital ("Part A") and outpatient ("Part B") providers.<p>

<p>These people will get a packet of data a couple of months before they flip sixty five or receive their twenty fifth month of Social Security Disability or Railroad Retirement Board benefits. At that time, they will select to maintain or decline Part B, however can’t decline Part A unless they withdraw their original application for Social Security and pay back all Social Security money benefits.

<p>If you did not enroll in prescription drug coverage during IEP, you can sign up for prescription drug coverage through the Annual Election Period that runs every year from October 15 to December 7.

<p>I would suggest addressing that issue with a union consultant and going from there. Some folks select to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a alternative then that’s something to first tackle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>But these averages mask wide regional and useful variations. Just as an important benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the major determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the size of that protection.

Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 yearly however of course -- for these plans -- the premium is higher. Note that an OOP limit isn't a deductible as is commonly reported.<p>
