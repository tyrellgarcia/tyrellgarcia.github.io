If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
