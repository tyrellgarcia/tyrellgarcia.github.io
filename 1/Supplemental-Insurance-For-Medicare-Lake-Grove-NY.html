<p>A rebate cannot contribute to "profit" ("profit" is in quotes because most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-profit organizations, primarily built-in health delivery techniques). In 2017, the typical out-of-pocket restrict for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the identical as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $4,313 in 2011 .

<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like vision, dental, eyeglasses, listening to aids, or prescription drug coverage.
