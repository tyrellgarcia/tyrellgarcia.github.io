Krugman cites all of the familiar figures from the remainder of the developed world, where some mix of public insurance with some private components manages to cover nearly everybody and at a much lower cost than in the United States. But that less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this nation by the private corporate interests who revenue from the costly mess of a health care system we now have now.
