<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
