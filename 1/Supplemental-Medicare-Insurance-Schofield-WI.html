<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a unique Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan.

<p>Consider plan prices, plan medical doctors, comfort, your life-style and travel plans, your health, and any further benefits in making your Medicare coverage decisions. Prioritize plan providers that supply low premiums and out-of-pocket maximums. Have a particular situation that requires extra customized companies? Work together with your main care provider and your loved ones to choose a plan you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use essentially the most. Advantage plans limit what you possibly can pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
