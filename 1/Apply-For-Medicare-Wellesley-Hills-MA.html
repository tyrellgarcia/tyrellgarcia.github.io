<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Is the 6 month retroactive period for medicare from the day medicare coverage starts or the day you apply for medicare coverage. Do I even have to cease HSA contributions on April 1 or May 1 (6 months again from date coverage starts.<p>
<p>You can enroll in Original Medicare on-line on the Social Security websiteor by calling or visiting your local Social Security workplace.
