<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans typically even have larger deductibles, so you must rigorously compare these plans along with your income before you decide. Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and complete estimated prices for folks like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay when you see the physician.<p>
<p>You can delay your Part B effective date as much as three months when you enroll while you still have employer-sponsored coverage or within one month after that coverage ends.
