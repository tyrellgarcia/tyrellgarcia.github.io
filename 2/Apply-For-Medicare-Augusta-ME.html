<p>If you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, most Medicare companies are coated through the plan and aren’t paid for underneath Original Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans provide prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Advantage plans, the essential Medicare Part A and Part B benefits – except hospice providers – are mechanically coated. As of 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been allowed to cover a broader range of extra benefits, including things like residence health aides, medical transportation, and the installation of in-residence security units.
