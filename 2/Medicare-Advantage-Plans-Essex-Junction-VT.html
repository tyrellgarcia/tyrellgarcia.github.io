<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium in your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans often even have higher deductibles, so you need to rigorously compare these plans along with your earnings before you decide. Instead of simply responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at each premiums and whole estimated costs for individuals like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might need a $15 copay whenever you see the doctor.<p>
