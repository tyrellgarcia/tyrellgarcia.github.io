You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Additionally, as beforehand discussed, premiums vary throughout plan sorts and enrollment by plan sort varies across states. These plans combine excessive-deductible insurance plan options with a medical savings account that you use specifically to cover healthcare costs.<p>
<p>But it seems such as you’ll be enrolling at Medicare at 65, during which case you don’t get retro benefits because you weren’t entitled to them prior to 65.
