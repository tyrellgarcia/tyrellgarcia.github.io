Medigap plans, like Medicare Advantage plans, are supplied through private insurance companies, and are available for purchase through brokers like eHealth Insurance Services, Inc. The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are routinely eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for instance, those who have labored or spouses have labored no less than 10 years, or 40 quarters, and paid Medicare taxes by way of their employment.
