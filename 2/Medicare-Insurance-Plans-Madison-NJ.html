<p>Some could pay a portion of out-of-community care, whereas others will cover only doctors and facilities which are within the HMO or PPO network. An MA plan should provide enrollees in that plan with coverage of all services which are covered by Medicare Parts A and B, plus extra benefits beyond those lined by Medicare. These plans are known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>You can also enroll in a Part D plan if you only enroll in Medicare Part B through the GEP. If you enroll in both Part A and Part B, you could choose to apply for a Medicare Advantage , Medicare Prescription Drug , or Medicare Supplement plan.
