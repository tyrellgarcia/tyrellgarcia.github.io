<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security at least four months before you turn sixty five, you'll need to sign up with Social Security to get Part A and Part B. I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board a minimum of 4 months before I turn sixty five.
