<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like imaginative and prescient, dental, eyeglasses, hearing aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you need prescription drugs, you would have to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Medicare Advantage, also referred to as Part C, replaces Original Medicare should you enroll in coverage. Advantage plans are offered by private insurance corporations and are required to cover every thing you'd have with Original Medicare.<p>

These plans are known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>HMOs — These plans provide medical coverage and health care from a selected set of docs, specialists, and hospitals which might be inside a plan's approved community. Original Medicare consists of Part A and Part B. Part A covers inpatient hospital companies, skilled nursing care facility bills and hospice care. Part B, which covers some medical doctors' providers, medical supplies, preventative care and outpatient care. One factor to find out about Original Medicare is that it doesn't pay for prescription drugs.<p>
<h3>Overusing Your Health Insurance in Hamlet</h3>

Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at each premiums and total estimated prices for people like yourself. For instance, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay whenever you see the physician.<p>
