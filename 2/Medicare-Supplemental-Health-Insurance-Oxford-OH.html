When very small employers be a part of along with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide main coverage so long as no less than one of many employers has 20+ workers. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check together with his group plan to see what their particular guidelines are.
