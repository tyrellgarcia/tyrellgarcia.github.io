<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
