You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
