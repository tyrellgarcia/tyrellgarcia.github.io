If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be relevant if you didn't join Medicare Part B whenever you had been first eligible.
