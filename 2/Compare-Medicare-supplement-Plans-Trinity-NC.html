<p>As a common rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not.

<p>You can delay your Part B effective date as much as three months if you enroll while you still have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends. Otherwise, your Part B coverage will start the month after you enroll. The Part B SEP allows beneficiaries to delay enrollment if they've health coverage by way of their own or a partner’s current employer.<p>
<p>Your Medicare coverage will start on the primary day of the month that you just turn sixty five if you apply initially of the initial enrollment interval. Medicare Advantage plans are handled through private insurance companies and embody the identical coverage as parts A and B. Some Medicare Advantage plans cover additional benefits like vision, listening to, and dental. Medicare enrollment may be done on-line, in person, or over the telephone through Social Security.<p>
<h3>Medicare Plan D Trinity North Carolina 27370</h3>

Enroll within the prescription drug plan if you’re first eligible to do so, in the course of the IEP for Part D.<p>
<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a special Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you qualify, you possibly can return to Original Medicare (Parts A & B) or be a part of, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Prescription Drug plan.
