<p>As a general rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not.

<p>You can contact the Social Security Administration at for more information, but in a nutshell, you’ll ask for a few specific forms that you simply’ll fill out or have your employer fill out. That’s the way you’ll provide proof that you simply’re entitled to a special enrollment interval.<p>
<p>Private Fee-For-Service plans PFFS plans could or could not have a provider community, but cover any provider who accepts Medicare. If the plan doesn’t embody prescription drug coverage, you may also enroll in a standalone Part D plan individually. Special Needs Plans Special Needs Plans have benefits that cover particular health care or monetary wants.<p>
