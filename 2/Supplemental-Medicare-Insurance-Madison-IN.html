<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium in your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans often also have higher deductibles, so you need to carefully compare these plans together with your revenue earlier than making a decision. Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and total estimated prices for individuals like your self. For instance, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay if you see the doctor.<p>
