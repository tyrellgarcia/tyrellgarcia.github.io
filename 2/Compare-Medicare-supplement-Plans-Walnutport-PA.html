If you delay enrolling in Medicare Part A and/or Part B after your Special Enrollment Period ends, you’ll have to wait till the following General Enrollment Period to enroll, and you may have to pay a late-enrollment penalty. You can even enroll in Medicare at any time that you are still working and have employer-primarily based coverage. For lengthy-time period care coverage, some individuals consider purchasing insurance specifically designed to cover these bills. If you fail to join Part B whenever you're imagined to, you'll face a ten p.c penalty for each year that you should have been enrolled.<p>

If you’re not being given a alternative then that’s one thing to first handle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to maintain it once you sign up. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment period that lasts eight months.
