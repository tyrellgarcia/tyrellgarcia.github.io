<p>For home companions (similar- and opposite-gender), Medicare will pay main to your UC medical plan. If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you just send in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your present coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).

If you’re currently working full-time and he or she is roofed through your plan, she may be able to safely delay enrolling in Medicare.<p>
