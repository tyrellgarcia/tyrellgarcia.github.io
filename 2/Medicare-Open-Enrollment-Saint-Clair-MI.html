<p>Third, people who live in two totally different geographical areas of the nation at different times of the 12 months (mostly so-known as snowbirds) find it tough to stay with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C threat adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is.
