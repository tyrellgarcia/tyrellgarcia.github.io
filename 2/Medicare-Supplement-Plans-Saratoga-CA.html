<p>But you’ll still have to pay the government a premium for Part B, in addition to the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage (which can be $0, relying on the plan). Any time in the course of the 12 months, an individual enrolled in Original Medicare can apply for a different Medigap plan. But if it’s not during the individual’s one-time Medigap enrollment window, the insurer will probably use medical underwriting to find out whether or not to problem the policy and at what price.<p>
<p>That is why having alternative between forms of Medicare and many decisions inside Part C is so essential.
