You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
