<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium on your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans usually also have higher deductibles, so you need to fastidiously compare these plans with your earnings before making a decision. Instead of simply responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check the entire Medicare options in your area. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at each premiums and total estimated prices for people like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan may need a $15 copay when you see the physician.<p>

By law, a Part C beneficiary cannot spend greater than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical companies; it's plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 yearly but after all -- for these plans -- the premium is larger.
