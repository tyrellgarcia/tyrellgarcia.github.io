<p>Third, individuals who stay in two totally different geographical areas of the nation at different occasions of the 12 months (mostly so-called snowbirds) discover it difficult to stay with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how effective that equalization program is.
