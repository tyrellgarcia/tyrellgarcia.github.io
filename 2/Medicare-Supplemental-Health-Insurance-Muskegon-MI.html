Krugman cites all the familiar figures from the remainder of the developed world, the place some mix of public insurance with some private components manages to cover almost everybody and at a much decrease cost than within the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk in this country by the private corporate pursuits who revenue from the expensive mess of a health care system we now have now.

<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it when you sign up. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment period that lasts eight months. Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age 65 if you have coverage via a certified group health plan, doing so may make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>
