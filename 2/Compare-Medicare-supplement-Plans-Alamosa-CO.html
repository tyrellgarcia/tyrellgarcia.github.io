<p>Be positive to be conscious that when he does take Social Security, he might be enrolled in Part A, effective six months retroactively. Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the year, which might lead to penalties.

<p>Most Americans start collecting social security as soon as they'll. And while that is fine should you don’t have a choice, should you can, holding off for a couple of years will enable you a bigger payout later. Medigap supplemental insurance policies are offered by private insurance firms to fill some of the gaps in expenses that standard Medicare won’t cover.
