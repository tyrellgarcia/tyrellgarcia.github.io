If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
