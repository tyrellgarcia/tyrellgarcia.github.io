<p>Similarly, individuals who spend a part of the year in a special geographical space could discover it troublesome to stay in community for medical care and could be better off with common Medicare and a Medigap insurance coverage.

<p>When you enroll, you’ll be asked if you wish to join Parts A and B, or Part A solely.
