<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman.

You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

For example, check to see if there may be another plan in your area that may give you better health and/or drug coverage at a extra inexpensive value.
