<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 need to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union legal guidelines mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>Remember, should you don’t sign up for Medicare whenever you’re first eligible and don’t produce other coverage based on current employment, you would should pay a late-enrollment penalty later if you do enroll.

<p>Similarly, individuals who spend part of the yr in a unique geographical area may discover it tough to remain in network for medical care and could be better off with common Medicare and a Medigap insurance coverage.
