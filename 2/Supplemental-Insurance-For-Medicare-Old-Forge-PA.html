<p>Medicare Advantage is a type of medical insurance plan in the United States that gives Medicare benefits via a private-sector health insurer.

<p>You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan when you’re first eligible for Medicare, or through the annual Medicare open enrollment period in the fall . If you’re enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B , you’re eligible to enroll in a Medigap plan to supplement your Medicare coverage. You’ll have a six-month assured-concern window throughout which you'll join any Medigap plan out there in your area. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll should go through medical underwriting if you resolve to use for a Medigap plan after that window ends. During the 5-star enrollment period (December 8 – November 30), people who reside in an area with a 5-star Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan can change to that plan if they select to take action.<p>
<p>Starting Medicare Part B at the right time might help ensure that you've got sturdy health coverage on the lowest cost to you.

<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare only through the Medicare common enrollment period . Generally, if a person remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they can delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later during a SEP.
