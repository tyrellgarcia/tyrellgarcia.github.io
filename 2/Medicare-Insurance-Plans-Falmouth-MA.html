<h3>Medicare Supplement Plan J Falmouth Massachusetts 02540</h3>
<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
