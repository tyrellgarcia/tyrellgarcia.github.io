Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).

You should communicate along with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you perceive how your present coverage works with Medicare and what the consequences can be if you drop Medicare Part B.<p>
