<p>A rebate can't contribute to "revenue" ("revenue" is in quotes as a result of most Medicare Advantage and different Part C health plans are sponsored by non-revenue organizations, primarily integrated health delivery techniques). In 2017, the average out-of-pocket limit for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the identical as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $4,313 in 2011 .
