<p>This means that you must enroll in Medicare when you are eligible and then TRICARE will fill in the gaps for some companies that Medicare would not cover. You get your coverage via the Affordable Care Act's medical insurance marketplace. Under the ACA, once you turn 65 you have to transition from an ACA plan to Medicare.<p>
<p>When you file on your own retirement benefit, you will receive an additional fee roughly equal to the quantity by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit. Social Security might call this entire quantity your retirement benefit, but we think that’s deceptive. It’s really an extra retirement benefit and definitely not a retirement benefit all by itself.
