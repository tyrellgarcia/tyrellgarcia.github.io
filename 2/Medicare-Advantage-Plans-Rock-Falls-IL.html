You can't have a Medicare Supplement plan and a Medicare Advantage plan at the identical time.

When very small employers join along with other employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide major coverage so long as at least one of many employers has 20+ staff. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check along with his group plan to see what their specific rules are. If you’re presently working full-time and he or she is roofed by way of your plan, she could possibly safely delay enrolling in Medicare.<p>
