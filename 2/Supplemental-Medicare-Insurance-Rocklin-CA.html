You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
