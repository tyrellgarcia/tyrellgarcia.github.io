Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare device at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and complete estimated costs for folks like your self. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay when you see the doctor.<p>
