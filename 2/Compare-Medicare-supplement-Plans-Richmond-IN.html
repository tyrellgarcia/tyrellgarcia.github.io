<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

You can qualify for particular enrollment if the plan has fewer than 20 employees; Medicare shall be primary vs. secondary to the group health plan primarily based on the variety of staff, although. You can not contribute to an HSA once you’re on Medicare.
