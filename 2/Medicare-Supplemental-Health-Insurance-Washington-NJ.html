You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
